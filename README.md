**QualiaKit** is an open-source framework designed to bridge the gap between digital text and human sensory perception. By combining **Natural Language Processing (BERT)** with **Haptic Feedback**, it allows users to "feel" the semantic weight of information.

> "Translating Sense (Meaning) into Sense (Feeling)."

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Embodied Semantics:** Transforms abstract text metrics (sentiment, aggression, suspense) into physical tactile patterns.
* **On-Device Intelligence:** Uses a highly optimized, pure-Swift implementation of WordPiece tokenization and CoreML BERT inference. Zero server dependency, 100% privacy.
* **Modular Architecture:**
    * `Perception`: Handling semantic understanding.
    * `Cortex`: Managing tactile stimulation patterns.
    * `Qualia`: The unified interface for semantic-haptic synthesis.
